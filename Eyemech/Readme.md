All the code along the way to get this bad boy working

Essentially a repo to save code so I have backups when I inevitably break the code that 'worked yesterday'
Schematics etc.

Approaching this as code for each separate section before eventually merging them all into one.

Head - The eyes, lights and speech
Neck - Head swivel using nema stepper and TMC2208 controller and two end stops so we don't go all Exorcist on the wiring.
Wings - Stepper Control to open close and position wings
Mouth - Voice to Stepper movement
